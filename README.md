## Notes

The home page has been separated from Rocket's main default styles and modules. Folders and files that belong to the home page in `/_includes`, `/_assets`, and `/_data` are prepended with `kh`.

For example:

1. In `/docs/_includes`, the folder named "/`kh`Hero", contains modules for the home page only.
2. The style sheet in `/docs/_assets` named "`/khHero.css`" sets styles for home page lander's Hero section
