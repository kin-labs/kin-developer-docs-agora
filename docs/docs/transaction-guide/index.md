# KRE Valid Transactions ||110

The purpose of the [KRE](/docs/the-kre-explained/) is to promote a healthy digital ecosystem that maximizes opportunity for participation and recognition for developers and safe and fair experiences for users.

If your appâ€™s experience aligns to that purpose and follows the guides below, then it's highly likely your transactions are compliant and will be considered valid.

## Spends

A `Spend` Transaction is a User-to-Developer or a User-to-User transaction.

| Do                                                                                             | Don't                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ensure the user is voluntarily initiating Spend Transactions.                                  | Automate Spend Transactions, force the user to initiate a transaction or debit the User's wallet without their authorisation. |
| Clearly communicate the cost of the transaction, and what the User will receive for their Kin. | Obfuscate or hide transaction amounts or leave out important transaction details.                                             |
| Clearly display the Kin logo on the action/button that triggers the Spend Transaction.         | Obfuscate or hide what currency is being spent.                                                                               |
| Let users know their Spend Transaction was completed                                           | Leave the user wondering whether their Spend Transaction was successful                                                       |
| Allow the user to reconfirm or undo their Spend intent when the amount is over 100 Kin         | Introduce single click or turn UI that could lead to accidental Spend Transactions when the amount is over 100 Kin            |

## Subscriptions

The initial payment of a Subscription is an ordinarily Spend Transaction, however subsequent payments for the subscription cost may occur automatically so therefore we have special rules about subscriptions.

| Do                                                                                                                                                                      | Don't                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ensure subscription purchases clearly shows the amount of Kin being charged, the length of the subscription period, what the user will receive, and how to unsubscribe. | Change the amount being charged during a subscription period or make it difficult to unsubscribe.                                                                                             |
| Only offer subscriptions in weekly, monthly or annual time periods.                                                                                                     | Don't offer subscription time periods that are less than one week.                                                                                                                            |
| Permit a user to unsubscribe at any time without further obligation to pay.                                                                                             | Make it difficult or impossible to unsubscribe or charge a user after they've unsubscribed.                                                                                                   |
| Ensure your app or web service is accessible by the general public.                                                                                                     | Violate the Terms of Use or any app store rules which host your app.                                                                                                                          |
| Offer safe, fair, equitable, and respectful products, services, activities or spaces.                                                                                   | Sell, promote or encourage violent, abusive, discriminatory, hateful, mean-spirited, bullying, harassing, pornographic, racial, or exploitative products, services, experiences or activities |
