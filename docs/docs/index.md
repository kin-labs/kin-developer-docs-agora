# Kin Docs Introduction

Welcome to the Kin Developer's Documentation. It contains everything required for developers to get started with integrating their apps with Kin.

### What is Kin?

Kin is a token on Solana, a consumer-grade blockchain built for scale. It can currently handle 65,000 transactions per second, so it can scale as well as most financial payment systems. Solana transaction times are roughly less < 1 second, making it perfect for the consumer applications of all sizes. Currently transactions made via the Kin SDKs is closer to ~2 seconds, but is being optimized every day. Solana is also extremely decentralized and secure. Read more at http://www.solana.com.

### Where to start

To effectively integrate the use of Kin into their apps, developers should first familiarize themselves with the high-level [architecture overview](/docs/architecture-overview/) and [how the system works](/docs/how-it-works/). Those who already have Kin-approved apps can also look to the [SDK migration](/docs/migration-to-new-sdks/) section for details on what has changed. Those who are new but are ready to get started and register can jump to the [App Registration](/docs/app-registration/) section.
