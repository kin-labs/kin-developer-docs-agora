# React Native ||60

### The React Native SDK can be added as a project dependency by using one of the following commands

```shell
# if using yarn
yarn add @kin-sdk/react-native

# if using npm
npm install @kin-sdk/react-native
```

### Add the [KinService.ts](https://github.com/kintegrate/kin-starter-react-native/blob/main/src/KinService.ts) class to your app

This class abstracts some calls to Kin's official SDK and is fully usable out of the box. However, you can easily extend it to suite your needs.

For details on how to use the React Native SDK, you can:

- Walk through the [React Native Tutorial](/tutorials/react-native/)
